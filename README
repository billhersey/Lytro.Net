This was a project I developed to create a sensible Windows UI for opening native Lytro files (.LFP) and extracting the JPEGs located within.

The majority of information I used to code this library and related app was obtained from Nirav Patel (https://github.com/nrpatel) and his genius observations of the native format (http://eclecti.cc/computervision/reverse-engineering-the-lytro-lfp-file-format).

Nirav's platform independent tools can be found here: https://github.com/nrpatel/lfptools/
